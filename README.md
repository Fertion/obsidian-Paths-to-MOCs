# Obsidian Paths to MOCs
The plugin displays chains of notes leading from the current note to Maps of Content (MOCs) either above the note or in the sidebar. It is useful for those who use links to structure their notes. Unlike other plugins, this one offers a simple view of note chains with flexible hierarchy customization. Parent notes can be defined through links in frontmatter properties, tags on referring notes, and the headers under which those links are located. This allows the plugin to adapt to your note storage structure, rather than the other way around.

# Examples of How to Use the Plugin
- Tag your MOCs (e.g., "#MOC") — all links in these notes will point to child notes.
- Specify specific headers (e.g., "Subprojects") — all links under this header will be treated as links to child notes.
- You can define a link to the parent note in a property (the property is chosen in the settings, for example "up").
- You can define links to child notes in a property (e.g., "down").
- All of these methods can be used simultaneously.
- If displaying the paths above the note is not convenient, you can disable it in the settings and add a similar panel to the sidebar through the "Show navigation paths in the side panel" command.
